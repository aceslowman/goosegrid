# goosegrid

goosegrid is a sequencer that can be used to live code and compose music 
(and other things that can be connected via MIDI). Notes are arranged along 
a grid, the sequencer plays connected cells from left to right and plays 
connected vertical notes as harmony.

The palatte is where you select notes that can be placed onto the grid.
Tap on any of the cells in the palatte to select, and then click within the grid
to place it. If you click and drag, you can extend notes over longer durations.

The toolbar is where you can affect playback and a handful of tools 
that can change the mode that you're currently in.

## MIDI

To use WebMIDI you will likely want to be on Chrome, and you will need to have some sort of virtual MIDI loopback. 

On Windows check out Tobias Erichsen's [loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html)

On MacOS you can use the built in IAC bus, which has to be enabled in Audio MIDI Setup. 

Check out [this article](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209774225-Setting-up-a-virtual-MIDI-bus) if you have issues.
